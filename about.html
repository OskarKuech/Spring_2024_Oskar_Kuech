            <p>As I love going to the movies, I've been looking for a long time for a source where I can check what movies are starting next in theaters in Germany or when a certain movie starts.</p>
            <p>Since the release days are not always the same in all countries (in Germany, films generally start on Thursdays, while in many other major countries such as America, they start on Fridays), not all the information that Google, Wikipedia, or other sites that appear at the top of searches is always accurate. Some movies even are released several weeks apart (e.g., Anyone But You, released in America on December 22, 23, in Germany only on January 18). </p> <br>
            <p>There are sites like IMDB where it is sorted by country, but you would have to navigate to the relevant page first. Therefore, the idea of the project is to display the latest releases directly and thus create a clear overview. In subcategories, the starts are then also listed thematically or by genre. At some point, a freely available API from "TheMovieDB" will automatically implement the data, thereby automating the process. </p>
            <p>Another idea is to create a Google Calendar for each user (who creates a profile), to which they can subscribe, in which the films they have selected are displayed as a kind of reminder (similar to the LUs on the Code website). </p>
